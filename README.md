# ownCloud Shell Integrations for Dolphin

This is the ownCloud shell integration for the great KDE Dolphin in KDE Frameworks 6.

It adds overlay icons for local directories that are synced with ownCloud server.
The icons visualize the sync state of the files.

Also, a context menu item is added to Dolphins context menu for synced diretories which
allows to access ownCloud specific functions for the file item such as sharing.
