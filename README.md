# `OpenCloud Desktop` Shell Integrations for Dolphin

This is the `OpenCloud Desktop` shell integration for the great KDE Dolphin in KDE Frameworks 6.

It adds overlay icons for local directories that are synced with `OpenCloud`.
The icons visualize the sync state of the files.

Also, a context menu item is added to Dolphins context menu for synced directories which
allows to access ownCloud specific functions for the file item such as sharing.
